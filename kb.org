* Prometheus
** Using the delta function
The [[http://prometheus.io/docs/querying/functions/#delta][delta]] function lets you graph monotonically incrementing counters as the difference in their value over a period of time. 
This example graphs the mongodb_op_counters_total variable's changes every 5 seconds: 

#+BEGIN_SRC js
delta(mongodb_op_counters_total[5s])
#+END_SRC
** Reloading the configuration 

The configuration file can be reloaded live by sending SIGHUP to the process: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
kill -SIGHUP $(pidof prometheus)
#+END_SRC

If the configuration has an error, it won't be applied, and the error message will be printed to stdout (or the appropriate log file if set)
